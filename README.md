# CS 2500A Final Project - James Bouchat | Owen Milke

## Description

For our final project, we decided to make a clone of eBay. Users can create an account, post listings, view and purchase listings, and view previous listings. Users can search for specific listings with key words, or listings within a price range.

## How to Run

Firstly, place all .html files into a folder titled "templates" in the same directory as app.py.
To run the program, go into the root directory of the project and enter:

```bash
flask --app app run
```

You will see something like this pop up:

```bash
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

Simply click on the part that says `https://127.0.0.1:5000`, and the website will open in your default browser.
